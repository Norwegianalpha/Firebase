# Sync with Mailchimp

**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)

**Description**: Adds new users from Firebase Authentication to a specified Mailchimp audience.



**Details**: Use this extension to add new users to an existing [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com) audience.

This extension adds the email address of each new user to your specified Mailchimp audience. Also, if the user deletes their user account for your app, this extension removes the user from the Mailchimp audience.

**Note:** To use this extension, you need to manage your users with Firebase Authentication.

This extension uses Mailchimp, so you'll need to supply your Mailchimp API Key and Audience ID when installing this extension.

#### Additional setup

Make sure that you've set up [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to manage your users.

You must also have a Mailchimp account before installing this extension.

* **mergeTagsHandler:** Listens for Firebase write events based on specified config path, then automatically classifies the document data as Mailchimp subscriber tags.

* **mergeFieldsHandler:** Listens for Firestore write events based on specified config path, then automatically populates a Mailchimp subscriber's respective merge fields.

* **memberEventsHandler:** Listens for Firestore write events based on specified config path, then automatically uses the document data to create a mailchimp event on the subscriber's profile which can subsequently kickoff automation workflows in Mailchimp.
